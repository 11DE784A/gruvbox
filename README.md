gruvbox
=======

Retro groove color scheme for Vim.

Gruvbox is heavily inspired by [badwolf][], [jellybeans][] and [solarized][].

Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of [solarized][]. The main focus when developing Gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.
