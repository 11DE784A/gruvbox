gruvbox
=======

Retro groove color scheme for Vim.

Well, it's just pretty first draft. Scheme is under active development right now, so you should check it maybe a month later.

Gruvbox is designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of [Solarized][]. The main focus when developing Gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and pleasant for the eyes.

That's a draft shot though it'll give you an approximate view of scheme.
